Testimonials plugin for RefineryCMS
http://github.com/resolve/Refinery

This is our first attempt at giving something back to the open source community. The guys at resolve
have done a great job with refinerycms and made the project easily extendable with engines. We hope
others find this plugin useful and would love to here any feedback or advice on improving it : )


Plugin Installation
===================
script/plugin install git://github.com/tsdbrown/refinery_testimonials.git
rake refinery_testimonials:install
rake db:migrate

Following the refinery conventions the standard install gives you a new tab in the
admin interface to manage your testimonials. There is also a new page added under
pages that is used to display your list in the front end.


Gem Installation
================
Coming soon...


Show a Random Testimonial On Any Page
=====================================
If like us you wish to show a random testimonial on pages you need to follow these
two basic steps:

1. Add <%= display_page_testimonial_if_setup %> into your layout where you would like to display them
   -> We've put ours in the sidebar under shared/_content_page.html.erb

2. Change the 'show_testimonials_on_pages' setting in the backend, there are three options:
   -> all  # Show one on every page (except testimonials)
   -> none # Turn off the random testimonial on all pages
   -> comma seperated list of page titles you want them on, i.e: news, contact us, home


If you want to run the tests add the following to environments/test.rb
config.gem "thoughtbot-shoulda", :lib => "shoulda", :source => "http://gems.github.com"
config.gem "mocha"
